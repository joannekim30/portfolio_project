  <h1> Hi, I'm Joanne! </h1>
</header>


<p> I am currently a first-year Masters student at the University of Michigan School of Information, concentrating in User Experience Research & Design and Human-Computer Interaction. I am passionate about solving real-world problems and impacting communities through research-backed design. I recently graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a BA in Neuroscience & Behavior and Music Performance. I tailored my Neuroscience major to be very similar to a Cognitive Science degree, and I also pursued various interdisciplinary projects on the side. This is how I discovered how my interest in research can combine well with my passion for creativity and problem solving to translate into a career in the interdisciplinary field of User Experience. <br> </p>


<p> This is my portfolio project for SI 539: Design of Complex Websites. I will write about my process so far on two of my favorite projects, so the content will be more like a blog that an actual portfolio. <br> </p>

<p> I'm also a classically-trained pianist -  my music major concentration was in piano performance, and I also play the violin. My last page will feature some pictures from my musical performances. <br> </p>
